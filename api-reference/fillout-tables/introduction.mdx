## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

<Warning>
  Ensure your API token has the appropriate permissions for the requested base or organization.

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Standard limits apply per API token.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error messages:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created successfully  
- `400` - Bad request (validation errors)
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Resource not found
- `409` - Conflict (duplicate names, etc.)
- `500` - Internal server error

Error responses include descriptive messages to help identify and resolve issues.
